# Huffman_File_Compressor
•	File Zipper for text ﬁles that compresses to make them smaller and faster to send, encodes and stores the ﬁle using Huffman Coding algorithm, which is lossless data compression algorithm.
•	A File Compression tool that helps zip/unzip ﬁles thus getting both the compressed and decompressed ﬁles thus helping to store data in less space , and easier to transfer over the network.
